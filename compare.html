		<h3>Pre-Registration System, or the Wishlist</h3>
		<p>A unique feature of our system is that users are able to "pre-register", meaning they are able to create a wishlist. They can save their desired courses, and register for all of them at once. They can access their wishlist through their profile. An example can be seen to the right.</p>

		<h3>A Running Schedule</h3>
		<p>Another feature of our system that Classfinder lacks is a running schedule. As a user adds and drops classes, our system will keep track of their current schedule. It contains information on each class they are currently registered for. An example can be seen to the right.</p>
		<p>Additionally, this feature stops users from registering for 2 courses with overlapping times. The user will be notified of this if they attempt it.</p>

		<h3>Concept of a Profile</h3>
		<p>Unlike Classfinder, our system has a user friendly profile with various options. From their profile, users are able to view and interact with their schedules and wishlists. The image to the right is what a profile looks like.</p>

		<h3>Colored Courses</h3>
		<p>Another unique feature of our system is that when viewing courses, they will be colored based on current registration status. If the user is registered, courses will come up as green. If they are not, they will come up as light gray. If they are waitlisted, they will come up as yellow. See an example to the right.</p>

		<h3>Waitlist Users Automatically Added</h3>
		<p>An interesting feature of our system is that when a registered user drops a full class, the first student on the waitlist will then be added. Not only this, but the user will be notified when this occurs. The notification will look something like this: </p>
